Dude, okay, so I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Amateur, and OMG, where do I even start? Talk about a rollercoaster. Like, first of all, I didn't expect it to go that hard, you know what I mean? I swear I was just planning to chill for the night, maybe 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   real quick, make some popcorn, and suddenly, I'm on the edge of my seat like some kind of suspense junkie.

Man, the pacing was wild though. One minute it's all quiet and you’re like, Yeah, okay, I can breathe, and the next, bam!, plot twist in your face. Kind of leaves you feeling dizzy, but hey, that’s what makes it fun, right? 

> So there's this one character—I literally can't remember her name right now. It's like it flew out of my head—but she’s totally badass one second and then totally lost the next. Like, come on, girl, get it together! And I'm just sitting there wishing I could jump into the screen and help her out.

Anyway, I gotta say, the cinematography was pretty on point. There were a few scenes where I just stopped and thought, “wow. But then I zoned out cause, seriously, it's hard to keep up with flashy visuals AND keep track of who's double-crossing whom. At one point I was like, am I even still 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  ?

I forgot to mention, the dialogue had some real zingers, but also some total cringe moments... Like, who even talks like that in real life? Although, to be fair, some lines were actually pretty memorable. I might even steal a couple for dramatic effect in convo, lol. 

Yeah, so, overall, it was kinda draining, but in a good way? If that makes sense. Catch it if you can. Or don’t. I mean, no pressure, but you might wanna grab some caffeine or something beforehand. Just saying.

int main() { return 0; }

And that's the tea. Let's see if I can get over this before the next flick, or at least get some sleep. 😂 What about you, caught anything interesting lately?
